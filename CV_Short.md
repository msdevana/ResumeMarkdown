## Objectives

PhD Student in Physical Oceanography seeking opportunities for marine or climate focused data analysis, machine learning research geared towards climate and environment issues, or green technology development in fast paced and innovative teams. Skilled in geospatial and time series data analysis, critical thinking and problem solving, assimilating new skills and knowledge efficiently, and communication of technical and research material with collaborators and wider audiences.

## Research Experience

1. **Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP)** [__2018-Present__]{style="float:right; white-space:nowrap;"}
   _Graduate Research Assistant, University of Miami_

   - Implemented a range of data analysis and exploration techniques including geospatial and interactive data visualizations, machine learning methods for data exploration and pattern detection, and statistical modelling in combination with analytical application of physical theories of ocean circulation and dynamics.
   - Geospatial data analysis with numerous types of datasets including: high resolution time series, unstructured spatial shipboard and ARGO observations, remote sensing observations (ocean altimetry and sea surface temperature), high resolution numerical model "big data", ocean, atmosphere reanalysis products.
   - Collaboration with researchers at institutions within the US and internationally on data analysis and field campaigns, and participate in OSNAP wide science team meetings.

2. **Internal Wave Dynamics** _Master's Student, University of Southampton_[__2015-2018__]{style="float:right"}

   - Examined high resolution hydrographic observations from the Southern Ocean to quantify internal wave activity over topographic features using spectral methods and parameterization techniques.
   - Simulated internal wave evolution by constructing a ray tracing model for 3-D evolving fields surrounding the observational site.
