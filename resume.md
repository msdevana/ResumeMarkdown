## Objectives

## Current Research Interests

I currently study deep ocean circulation in the North Atlantic Program as a PhD student under the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP). My research examines abyssal flows across a wide range of physical and temporal scales to understand how flow varies in strength, position, and its hydrographic properties.

## Research Experience

1. Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP): **Graduate Research Assistant**
2. Time series analysis investigating spatial and temporal variability of ocean currents using moored observations
3. Geospatial data analysis using a large range of data types and parameters from satellite derived datasets, lagrangian observations, and model outputs.
4. Experience applying ARGO Float data in a range of forms ranging from raw float data to various derived products

## Fieldwork Experience

1. RAPID-MOCHA Mooring Recovery and Hydrographic Survey Cruise _2018 November_
2. OSNAP Mooring Recovery and Hydrographic Survey Cruise _2019 September_
3. RAPID-MOCHA Mooring Recovery and Hydrographic Survey Cruise _2021 September_
4. OSNAP Mooring Recovery and Hydrographic Survey Cruise _2022 August_
